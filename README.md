# CofeeMachine
## About project
 What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? Two cups. Press a couple of buttons on the machine, and, voilà, a burst of raw energy is in your hands. But first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, I'm work on a coffee machine simulator. This machine uses regular ingredients — coffee, milk, and plastic cups. Should it run out of something, it will show you a notification. Our device will serve espresso, cappuccino, and latte. And since nothing is for free, it will also charge coffee lovers for a cup.
